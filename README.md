# cordova-plugin-cs-disable-bitcode

> [Cordova plugin](https://github.com/csantanapr/cordova-plugin-cs-disable-bitcode) to disable bitcode in iOS build settings.

> Why this plugin ?
Bitcode is not supported in every Cordova plugins and if you're using one of these, you will get something like the following error :
```
You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain
an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target.
for architecture arm64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1
```

> :warning: It's not a solution to disable this setting but a workaround waiting for all your plugins updates.
